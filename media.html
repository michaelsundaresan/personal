<p>
Q: Who did you listen to growing up?  Who were your favorite bands?<br/>
</p>
<p>
A: I remember being 8 or so and "Ride the Lightning" came out.  It<br/>
blew my mind.  My older brother got me into Megadeth, and I really<br/>
liked the raw emotion of the "Peace Sells" album and "So Far..So<br/>
Good..So What!".  Rust in Peace and Holy Wars were my favorite songs<br/>
in 7th grade, I remember it to this day.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Then 1990 came around and I heard "Seasons in the Abyss" on<br/>
Headbanger's Ball.  That was revolutionary for me.  The riffs were so<br/>
sharp, and the solos are phenomenal, Hanneman's especially.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Q: What is the name of your project?<br/>
</p>
<p>
A: "Bitter Revelations".<br/>
</p>
<p>
Q: Why that title?<br/>
</p>
<p>
A: It sums up the initial stages of the spiritual path I have followed<br/>
in life.  Not all truth is beauty.  Earlier in life, I thought that<br/>
life is futile, religion questionable, and God at best was like the<br/>
Great Clock Maker, designing the universe and its constituents and<br/>
setting in perpetual motion the wheels of time.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Q: Negative thoughts.<br/>
</p>
<p>
A: Well mostly negative.  I think the concept of God being the Great<br/>
Clock Maker is neutral.<br/>
</p>

<p>
Q: Where do you stand this day on your feeling of a Higher Power?
</p>
<p>
A: I believe in God the Creator of the Universe, the sustaining force,<br/>
and that also within every man and woman is a spark of the divine fire.
